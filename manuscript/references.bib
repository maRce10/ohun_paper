   abstract = {Genetic data from polymorphic microsatellite loci were employed to estimate paternity and maternity in a local population of nine-banded armadillos (Dasypus novemcinctus) in northern Florida. The parentage assessments took advantage of maximum likelihood procedures developed expressly for situations when individuals of neither gender can be excluded a priori as candidate parents. The molecular data for 290 individuals, interpreted alone and in conjunction with detailed biological and spatial information for the population, demonstrate high exclusion probabilities and reasonably strong likelihoods of genetic parentage assignment in many cases; low mean probabilities of successful reproductive contribution to the local population by individual armadillo adults in a given year; and statistically significant microspatial associations of parents and their offspring. Results suggest that molecular assays of highly polymorphic genetic systems can add considerable power to assessments of biological parentage in natural populations even when neither parent is otherwise known.},

   abstract = {Water striders have become a model system for studies of sexual conflict and coevolution, but progress is currently limited by a lack of genetic resources. Next-generation sequencing technologies offer the potential for rapid and cost-effective development of molecular markers and hold particular promise for model organisms in ecology for which no reference genome exists. We used Roche 454 sequencing of genomic DNA to identify microsatellite loci for the water strider Gerris incognitus. A modest sequencing volume generated 182 912 reads, of which 30 820 (16.8%) contained microsatellite repeats. We selected 23 loci for primer development, based on criteria that maximized the likelihood of amplifying polymorphic loci, and tested them in G. incognitus and the related species G. buenoi. Of the 16 amplifying loci, 10 yielded reliable amplification and detectable polymorphism, with an average of 6.1 alleles per locus (range: 2-12). These markers should facilitate new avenues of study, including postcopulatory sexual selection, population genetic structure, phylogeography, and sexual coevolution, for a key taxon in studies of mating conflict. The current study demonstrates an effective method for microsatellite development and shows that light sequencing of genomic DNA can provide numerous and highly variable markers.},

During the past few decades, this species has become endangered due to the loss of habitats and overfishing. Despite this species' importance, information on its genetic background is scarce. In this study, we developed microsatellite markers for M. coruscus using next-generation sequencing. A total of 263,900 raw reads were obtained from a quarter-plate run on the 454 GS-FLX titanium platform, and 176,327 unique sequences were generated with an average length of 381 bp; 2569 (1.45%) sequences contained a minimum of five di- to tetra-nucleotide repeat motifs. Of the 51 loci screened, 46 were amplified successfully, and 22 were polymorphic among 30 individuals, with seven of trinucleotide repeats and three of tetranucleotide repeats. All loci exhibited high genetic variability, with an average of 17.32 alleles per locus, and the mean observed and expected heterozygosities were 0.67 and 0.90, respectively. In addition, cross-amplification was tested for all 22 loci in another congener species, M. galloprovincialis. None of the primer pairs resulted in effective amplification, which might be due to their high mutation rates. Our work demonstrated the utility of next-generation 454 sequencing as a method for the rapid and cost-effective identification of microsatellites. The high degree of polymorphism exhibited by the 22 newly developed microsatellites will be useful in future conservation genetic studies of this species.},

A total of 40577 contigs were assembled, which contained 1379 SSRs. In these SSRs, the number of dinucleotide repeats were the most frequent (77.08%) and AC repeats were the most frequently occurring microsatellite, followed by AG, AAT and AT. Fifty loci were randomly selected for primer development; of these, 38 loci were successfully amplified and 29 loci were polymorphic across panels of 30 individuals. The H(o) ranged from 0.15 to 0.83, and H(e) ranged from 0.15 to 0.85, with 3.5 alleles per locus on average. Cross-species utility indicated that 20 of these markers were successfully amplified in a related, also an endangered fish species, S. irregularis. This study suggests that PGM&8482; sequencing is a rapid and cost-effective tool for developing microsatellite markers for non-model species and the developed microsatellite markers in this study would be useful in Schizothorax genetic analysis.},

   abstract = {Likelihood-based parentage inference depends on the distribution of a likelihood-ratio statistic, which, in most cases of interest, cannot be exactly determined, but only approximated by Monte Carlo simulation. We provide importance-sampling algorithms for efficiently approximating very small tail probabilities in the distribution of the likelihood-ratio statistic. These importance-sampling methods allow the estimation of small false-positive rates and hence permit likelihood-based inference of parentage in large studies involving a great number of potential parents and many potential offspring. We investigate the performance of these importance-sampling algorithms in the context of parentage inference using single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data and find that they may accelerate the computation of tail probabilities >1 millionfold. We subsequently use the importance-sampling algorithms to calculate the power available with SNPs for large-scale parentage studies, paying particular attention to the effect of genotyping errors and the occurrence of related individuals among the members of the putative mother-father-offspring trios. These simulations show that 60-100 SNPs may allow accurate pedigree reconstruction, even in situations involving thousands of potential mothers, fathers, and offspring. In addition, we compare the power of exclusion-based parentage inference to that of the likelihood-based method. Likelihood-based inference is much more powerful under many conditions; exclusion-based inference would require 40% more SNP loci to achieve the same accuracy as the likelihood-based approach in one common scenario. Our results demonstrate that SNPs are a powerful tool for parentage inference in large managed and/or natural populations.},

   abstract = {Advances in next generation technologies have driven the costs of DNA sequencing down to the point that genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) is now feasible for high diversity, large genome species. Here, we report a procedure for constructing GBS libraries based on reducing genome complexity with restriction enzymes (REs). This approach is simple, quick, extremely specific, highly reproducible, and may reach important regions of the genome that are inaccessible to sequence capture approaches. By using methylation-sensitive REs, repetitive regions of genomes can be avoided and lower copy regions targeted with two to three fold higher efficiency. This tremendously simplifies computationally challenging alignment problems in species with high levels of genetic diversity. The GBS procedure is demonstrated with maize (IBM) and barley (Oregon Wolfe Barley) recombinant inbred populations where roughly 200,000 and 25,000 sequence tags were mapped, respectively. An advantage in species like barley that lack a complete genome sequence is that a reference map need only be developed around the restriction sites, and this can be done in the process of sample genotyping. In such cases, the consensus of the read clusters across the sequence tagged sites becomes the reference. Alternatively, for kinship analyses in the absence of a reference genome, the sequence tags can simply be treated as dominant markers. Future application of GBS to breeding, conservation, and global species and population surveys may allow plant breeders to conduct genomic selection on a novel germplasm or species without first having to develop any prior molecular tools, or conservation biologists to determine population structure without prior knowledge of the genome or diversity in the species.},

   abstract = {The evidence that frequency modulated (FM) 50 kHz ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) reflect a positive emotional state in rats is reviewed. Positive emotional states in humans are measured by facial-vocal displays (e.g., Duchenne smiling and laughter), approach behavior, and subjective self-report of feeling states. In laboratory animals, only facial-vocal displays, along with approach behavior can be measured. FM 50. kHz USVs are uniquely elevated by hedonic stimuli and suppressed by aversive stimuli. Rates of FM 50. kHz USVs are positively correlated to the rewarding value of the eliciting stimulus. Additionally, playbacks of these vocalizations are rewarding. The neural and pharmacological substrates of 50. kHz USVs are consistent with those of human positive affective states. By experimentally eliciting FM 50. kHz USVs, the novel molecular underpinning of positive affect can be elucidated and may be similar to those in humans. In humans, positive emotional states confer resilience to depression and anxiety, as well as promote overall health. Using rough-and-tumble play induced hedonic USVs, we have identified insulin like growth factor I and the NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor as playing a functional role in positive affective states. From this research, we have developed a promising new class of antidepressants that is entering phase II clinical trials for the treatment of depression. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {Vocalizations of anuran amphibians have received much attention in studies of behavioral ecology and physiology, but also provide informative characters for identifying and delimiting species. We here review the terminology and variation of frog calls from a perspective of integrative taxonomy, and provide hands-on protocols for recording, analyzing, comparing, interpreting and describing these sounds. Our focus is on advertisement calls, which serve as premating isolation mechanisms and, therefore, convey important taxonomic information. We provide recommendations for terminology of frog vocalizations, with call, note and pulse being the fundamental subunits to be used in descriptions and comparisons. However, due to the complexity and diversity of these signals, an unequivocal application of the terms call and note can be challenging. We therefore provide two coherent concepts that either follow a note-centered approach (defining uninterrupted units of sound as notes, and their entirety as call) or a call-centered approach (defining uninterrupted units as call whenever they are separated by long silent intervals) in terminology. Based on surveys of literature, we show that numerous call traits can be highly variable within and between individuals of one species. Despite idiosyncrasies of species and higher taxa, the duration of calls or notes, pulse rate within notes, and number of pulses per note appear to be more static within individuals and somewhat less affected by temperature. Therefore, these variables might often be preferable as taxonomic characters over call rate or note rate, which are heavily influenced by various factors. Dominant frequency is also comparatively static and only weakly affected by temperature, but depends strongly on body size. As with other taxonomic characters, strong call divergence is typically indicative of species-level differences, whereas call similarities of two populations are no evidence for them being conspecific. Taxonomic conclusions can especially be drawn when the general advertisement call structure of two candidate species is radically different and qualitative call differences are thus observed. On the other hand, quantitative differences in call traits might substantially vary within and among conspecific populations, and require careful evaluation and analysis. We provide guidelines for the taxonomic interpretation of advertisement call differences in sympatric and allopatric situations, and emphasize the need for an integrative use of multiple datasets (bio-acoustics, morphology, genetics), particularly for allopatric scenarios. We show that small-sized frogs often emit calls with frequency components in the ultrasound spectrum, although it is unlikely that these high frequencies are of biological relevance for the majority of them, and we illustrate that detection of upper harmonics depends also on recording distance because higher frequencies are attenuated more strongly. Bioacoustics remains a prime approach in integrative taxonomy of anurans if uncertainty due to possible intraspecific variation and technical artifacts is adequately considered and acknowledged.},

Animals produce sounds for diverse biological functions such as defending territories, attracting mates, deterring predators, navigation, finding food and maintaining contact with members of their social group. Biologists can take advantage of these acoustic behaviours to gain valuable insights into the spatial and temporal scales over which individuals and populations interact. Advances in bioacoustic technology, including the development of autonomous cabled and wireless recording arrays, permit data collection at multiple locations over time. These systems are transforming the way we study individuals and populations of animals and are leading to significant advances in our understandings of the complex interactions between animals and their habitats. 2.

Research suggests that social calls may also be used to transfer information about roosts, but no studies have yet demonstrated that calls are used to actively attract conspecifics to roosting locations. We document the social calls used by Spix's disc-winged bat (Thyroptera tricolor) to actively recruit group members to roosts. In acoustic trials, we recorded two sets of calls; one from flying individuals termed 'inquiry calls', and another from roosting bats termed 'response calls'. Inquiry calls were emitted by flying bats immediately upon release, and quickly (i.e. 178 ms) elicited production of response calls from roosting individuals.

   abstract = {Animals produce a wide array of sounds with highly variable acoustic structures. It is possible to understand the causes and consequences of this variation across taxa with phylogenetic comparative analyses. Acoustic and evolutionary analyses are rapidly increasing in sophistication such that choosing appropriate acoustic and evolutionary approaches is increasingly difficult. However, the correct choice of analysis can have profound effects on output and evolutionary inferences. Here, we identify and address some of the challenges for this growing field by providing a roadmap for quantifying and comparing sound in a phylogenetic context for researchers with a broad range of scientific backgrounds. Sound, as a continuous, multidimensional trait can be particularly challenging to measure because it can be hard to identify variables that can be compared across taxa and it is also no small feat to process and analyse the resulting high-dimensional acoustic data using approaches that are appropriate for subsequent evolutionary analysis. Additionally, terminological inconsistencies and the role of learning in the development of acoustic traits need to be considered. Phylogenetic comparative analyses also have their own sets of caveats to consider. We provide a set of recommendations for delimiting acoustic signals into discrete, comparable acoustic units. We also present a three-stage workflow for extracting relevant acoustic data, including options for multivariate analyses and dimensionality reduction that is compatible with phylogenetic comparative analysis. We then summarize available phylogenetic comparative approaches and how they have been used in comparative bioacoustics, and address the limitations of comparative analyses with behavioural data. Lastly, we recommend how to apply these methods to acoustic data across a range of study systems. In this way, we provide an integrated framework to aid in quantitative analysis of cross-taxa variation in animal sounds for comparative phylogenetic analysis. In addition, we advocate the standardization of acoustic terminology across disciplines and taxa, adoption of automated methods for acoustic feature extraction, and establishment of strong data archival practices for acoustic recordings and data analyses. Combining such practices with our proposed workflow will greatly advance the reproducibility, biological interpretation, and longevity of comparative bioacoustic studies.},

They are studied in bioacoustics and ecoacoustics, with signal processing and analysis an important component. Computational bioacoustics has accelerated in recent decades due to the growth of affordable digital sound recording devices, and to huge progress in informatics such as big data, signal processing and machine learning. Methods are inherited from the wider field of deep learning, including speech and image processing. However, the tasks, demands and data characteristics are often different from those addressed in speech or music analysis. There remain unsolved problems, and tasks for which evidence is surely present in many acoustic signals, but not yet realised. In this paper I perform a review of the state of the art in deep learning for computational bioacoustics, aiming to clarify key concepts and identify and analyse knowledge gaps. Based on this, I offer a subjective but principled roadmap for computational bioacoustics with deep learning: topics that the community should aim to address, in order to make the most of future developments in AI and informatics, and to use audio data in answering zoological and ecological questions.},

   abstract = {Songbirds acquire songs by imitation, as humans do speech. Although imitation should drive convergence within a group and divergence through drift between groups, zebra finch songs sustain high diversity within a colony, but mild variation across colonies. We investigated this phenomenon by analyzing vocal learning statistics in 160 tutor-pupil pairs from a large breeding colony. Song imitation is persistently accurate in some families, but poor in others. This is not attributed to genetic differences, as fostered pupils copied their tutors’ songs as accurately or poorly as biological pupils. Rather, pupils of tutors with low song diversity make more improvisations compared to pupils of tutors with high song diversity. We suggest that a frequency dependent balanced imitation prevents extinction of rare song elements and overabundance of common ones, promoting repertoire diversity within groups, while constraining drift across groups, which together prevents the collapse of vocal culture into either complete uniformity or chaos. Studying how songbirds learn songs can shed light on the development of human speech. An analysis of 160 tutor-pupil zebra finch pairs suggests that frequency dependent balanced imitation prevents the extinction of rare song elements and the overabundance of common ones, promoting song diversity within groups and species recognition across groups.},

Advances in bioacoustic technologies offer new opportunities for bat monitoring. In this study, we present a method to monitor small and medium-sized cave-dwelling bat colonies using low-cost AudioMoth passive acoustic recorders. We develop a method to convert bat passes, a measure of acoustic activity, to an estimated number of bats in the roost. To do so, we took audio-visual recordings of five Miniopterus schreibersii colonies emerging from their roosts over 25 nights. We compared the accuracy of the estimates when using site-specific acoustic data against a combined global dataset and examined the influence of the detector position on the estimates. Site-specific acoustic datasets recorded at the cave entrance showed to be adequate to estimate roost bat numbers. In addition, we acoustically monitored one cave during three months of continuous sampling to test our protocol and compared the resulting data with historical datasets of roost occupancy. This method provides a low-cost, non-invasive and simple approach to monitor seasonal and inter-year roost dynamics that can easily be implemented in long-term monitoring programmes and citizen science projects.},

   abstract = {Article impact statement: Addressing financing, coordination, and capacity-building constraints is critical to the development and adoption of conservation technology. Abstract Conservation technology holds the potential to vastly increase conservationists' ability to understand and address critical environmental challenges, but systemic constraints appear to hamper its development and adoption. Understanding of these constraints and opportunities for advancement remains limited. We conducted a global online survey of 248 conservation technology users and developers to identify perceptions of existing tools' current performance and potential impact, user and developer constraints, and key opportunities for growth. We also conducted focus groups with 45 leading experts to triangu-late findings. The technologies with the highest perceived potential were machine learning and computer vision, eDNA and genomics, and networked sensors. A total of 95%, 94%, and 92% respondents, respectively, rated them as very helpful or game changers. The most pressing challenges affecting the field as a whole were competition for limited funding, duplication of efforts, and inadequate capacity building. A total of 76%, 67%, and 55% respondents, respectively, identified these as primary concerns. The key opportunities for growth identified in focus groups were increasing collaboration and information sharing, improving the interoperability of tools, and enhancing capacity for data analyses at scale. Some constraints appeared to disproportionately affect marginalized groups. Respondents in countries with developing economies were more likely to report being constrained by upfront costs, maintenance costs, and development funding (p = 0.048, odds ratio [OR] = 2.78; p = 0.005, OR = 4.23; p = 0.024, OR = 4.26), and female respondents were more likely to report being constrained by development funding and perceived technical skills (p = 0.027, OR = 3.98; p = 0.048, OR = 2.33). To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to formally capture the perspectives and needs of the global conservation technology community, providing foundational data that can serve as a benchmark to measure progress. We see tremendous potential for this community to further the vision they define, in which collaboration trumps competition; solutions are open, accessible, and interoperable; and user-friendly processing tools empower the rapid translation of data into conservation action. Article impact statement: Addressing financing, coordination, and capacity-building constraints is critical to the development and adoption of conservation technology. Resumen La tecnología de conservación tiene el potencial para incrementar considerablemente la habilidad de los conservacionistas para entender y lidiar con los retos ambientales más importantes, pero las restricciones sistémicas parecen dificultar su desarrollo y adopción. La comprensión de estas restricciones y las oportunidades para el avance todavía son lim-itadas. Encuestamos en línea a 248 usuarios y programadores mundiales de tecnología de conservación para identificar las percepciones existentes del desempeño e impacto poten-cial de las herramientas actuales, restricciones para los usuarios y programadores y oportu-nidades clave para el crecimiento. También realizamos grupos de discusión con 45 expertos destacados para triangular los hallazgos. Las tecnologías con el potencial percibido más alto fueron el aprendizaje mecánico y la visión por computadora, la genómica y el eADN y los sensores en red. El 95%, 94% y 92% de los respondientes, respectivamente, clasificó estas tecnologías como muy útiles o como puntos de inflexión. Los retos más apremiantes que afectaron al área como conjunto fueron la competencia por el financiamiento limitado, la duplicación de esfuerzos y el desarrollo inadecuado de capacidades. El 76%, 67% y 55% de los respondientes, respectivamente, identificaron estos retos como de interés primario. Las oportunidades clave para el crecimiento que se identificaron en los grupos de diál-ogo fueron el incremento de la colaboración y la distribución de información, la mejoría de la operatividad entre herramientas y la potenciación de la capacidad de análisis de datos a escala. Algunas restricciones parecieron afectar desproporcionadamente a grupos marginalizados. Los respondientes de países con economías en desarrollo tuvieron mayor probabilidad de reportar la restricción por los costos iniciales, costos de mantenimiento y la financiación del desarrollo (p = 0.048, tasa de probabilidad [OR] = 2.78; p = 0.005, OR = 4.23; p = 0.024, OR = 4.26), y las mujeres respondientes tuvieron una mayor prob-abilidad de reportar restricciones por la financiación del desarrollo y habilidades técnicas percibidas (p = 0.027, OR = 3.98; p = 0.048, OR = 2.33). A nuestro entendimiento, este es el primero intento por capturar formalmente las perspectivas y necesidades de la comu-nidad mundial de la tecnología de conservación, proporcionando datos fundamentales que pueden servir como referencia para medir el progreso. Vemos un potencial tremendo para que esta comunidad amplíe la visión que definen, en la cual la colaboración se sobrepone a la competencia; las soluciones son abierta, accesibles e interoperativas; y las herramientas intuitivas de procesamiento capacitan la traducción veloz de datos a acciones de conser-vación.},

   abstract = {1. High-throughput environmental sensing technologies are increasingly central to global monitoring of the ecological impacts of human activities. In particular, the recent boom in passive acoustic sensors has provided efficient, noninvasive, and taxonomically broad means to study wildlife populations and communities, and monitor their responses to environmental change. However, until recently, technological costs and constraints have largely confined research in passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) to a handful of taxonomic groups (e.g., bats, cetaceans, birds), often in relatively small-scale, proof-of-concept studies. 2. The arrival of low-cost, open-source sensors is now rapidly expanding access to PAM technologies, making it vital to evaluate where these tools can contribute to broader efforts in ecology and biodiversity research. Here, we synthesise and critically assess the current emerging opportunities and challenges for PAM for ecological assessment and monitoring of both species populations and communities. 3. We show that terrestrial and marine PAM applications are advancing rapidly, facilitated by emerging sensor hardware, the application of machine learning innovations to automated wildlife call identification, and work towards developing acoustic biodiversity indicators. However, the broader scope of PAM research remains constrained by limited availability of reference sound libraries and open-source audio processing tools, especially for the tropics, and lack of clarity around the accuracy, transferability and limitations of many analytical methods. 4. In order to improve possibilities for PAM globally, we emphasise the need for col-laborative work to develop standardised survey and analysis protocols, publicly archived sound libraries, multiyear audio datasets, and a more robust theoretical and analytical framework for monitoring vocalising animal communities.

Abstract 1. The study of the diversity of animal signals on within-and among-species levels is the key to uncover mechanisms that shape the evolution of communication systems. However, the methods used to quantify acoustic diversity (like repertoire size) lack to grasp several aspects of acoustic diversity. Here, we propose a new framework for the study of animal communication, in which we decompose the acoustic diversity with the methodological toolbox from community ecology. 2. We explore how different diversity estimates reflecting different aspects of acoustic diversity can be applied to characterise the complexity of acoustic signals. We propose that this approach can be used in a wide range of animal taxa to derive further insights about the function and evolution of communication systems besides the traditional methods. 3. To illustrate the use of our approach in a case study, we used the song of the col-lared flycatcher Ficedula albicollis as model system. Based on three frequency and time variables, we calculated three functional diversity indices (FRic, FEve and FDiv) to characterise the distribution of song elements (syllables) in the acoustic parameter space. We aimed to uncover the interrelations of diversity indices, reveal the degree of among-individual consistency and investigate their relationships with certain aspects of individual quality (body condition, age and arrival date). 4. We found that the diversity indices were largely independent of each other and showed different consistency patterns that were timescale dependent, indicating different signalling potential of individual-specific attributes. We also found that FEve strongly related to the age of males. Our case study showed that decomposing the diversity into different components can reveal additional biologically meaningful aspects of birdsong.},

We describe call structures of 15 katydid species from the Indian subcontinent. The habitat and seasonal variations of the communities were investigated at both sites. Most species observed produced ultrasonic broadband calls (bandwidth: 11.07–42.5 kHz); only two Pseudophyllinae members produced pure tone calls. The study includes calls of two previously undescribed species of the genus Ducetia (subfamily: Phaneropterinae) from the subcontinent. We observed diverse acoustic communities at both sites represented by five major subfamilies: Conocephalinae, Hexacentriane, Mecopodinae, Phaneropterinae and Pseudophyllinae. The acoustic communities at each site exhibited seasonal variations and habitat preferences. The post-monsoon season had a richer community composition than the dry season. We compared differences in the community compositions between habitats using a presence–absence matrix based on 526 individuals from the two sites. Species composition was found to be different among habitats (stress =.06, dimension: 2), with ANOSIM indicating separation of species among understorey, shrubland and grassland habitats.},

   abstract = {A method is described for the automatic recognition of transient animal sounds. Automatic recognition can be used in wild animal research, including studies of behavior, population, and impact of anthropogenic noise. The method described here, spectrogram correlation, is well-suited to recognition of animal sounds consisting of tones and frequency sweeps. For a sound type of interest, a two-dimensional synthetic kernel is constructed and cross-correlated with a spectrogram of a recording, producing a recognition function--the likelihood at each point in time that the sound type was present. A threshold is applied to this function to obtain discrete detection events, instants at which the sound type of interest was likely to be present. An extension of this method handles the temporal variation commonly present in animal sounds. Spectrogram correlation was compared to three other methods that have been used for automatic call recognition: matched filters, neural networks, and hidden Markov models. The test data set consisted of bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) end notes from songs recorded in Alaska in 1986 and 1988. The method had a success rate of about 97.5% on this problem, and the comparison indicated that it could be especially useful for detecting a call type when relatively few (5-200) instances of the call type are known.},

   abstract = {Automated signal recognition software is increasingly used to extract species detection data from acoustic recordings collected using autonomous recording units (ARUs), but there is little practical guidance available for ecologists on the application of this technology. Performance evaluation is an important part of employing automated acoustic recognition technology because the resulting data quality can vary with a variety of factors. We reviewed the bioacoustic literature to summarize performance evaluation and found little consistency in evaluation, metrics employed, or terminology used. We also found that few studies examined how score threshold, i.e., cut-off for the level of confidence in target species classification, affected performance, but those that did showed a strong impact of score threshold on performance. We used the lessons learned from our literature review and best practices from the field of machine learning to evaluate the performance of five readily-available automated signal recognition programs. We used the Common Nighthawk (Chordeiles minor) as our model species because it has simple, consistent, and frequent vocalizations. We found that automated signal recognition was effective for determining Common Nighthawk presence-absence and call rate, particularly at low score thresholds, but that occupancy estimates from the data processed with recognizers were consistently lower than from data generated by human listening and became unstable at high score thresholds. Of the five programs evaluated, our convolutional neural network (CNN) recognizer performed best, with recognizers built in Song Scope and MonitoR also performing well. The RavenPro and Kaleidoscope recognizers were moderately effective, but produced more false positives than the other recognizers. Finally, we synthesized six general recommendations for ecologists who employ automated signal recognition software, including what to use as a test benchmark, how to incorporate score threshold, what metrics to use, and how to evaluate efficiency. Future studies should consider our recommendations to build a body of literature on the effectiveness of this technology for avian research and monitoring.},

   abstract = {Traditionally, animal species diversity and abundance is assessed using a variety of methods that are generally costly, limited in space and time, and most importantly, they rarely include a permanent record. Given the urgency of climate change and the loss of habitat, it is vital that we use new technologies to improve and expand global biodiversity monitoring to thousands of sites around the world. In this article, we describe the acoustical component of the Automated Remote BiodiversityMonitoring Network (ARBIMON), a novel combination of hardware and software for automating data acquisition, data management, and species identification based on audio recordings. The major components of the cyberinfrastructure include: a solar powered remote monitoring station that sends 1-min recordings every 10 min to a base station, which relays the recordings in real-time to the project server, where the recordings are processed and uploaded to the project website (arbimon.net). Along with a module for viewing, listening, and annotating recordings, the website includes a species identification interface to help users create machine learning algorithms to automate species identification. To demonstrate the system we present data on the vocal activity patterns of birds, frogs, insects, and mammals from Puerto Rico and Costa Rica. © 2013 Aide et al.},

   abstract = {One hour before sunrise, one can experience the dawn chorus where birds from
different species sing together. In this scenario, high levels of polyphony, as
in the number of overlapping sound sources, are prone to happen resulting in a
complex acoustic outcome. Sound Event Detection (SED) tasks analyze acoustic
scenarios in order to identify the occurring events and their respective
temporal information. However, highly dense scenarios can be hard to process
and have not been studied in depth. Here we show, using a Convolutional
Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN), how birdsong polyphonic scenarios can be
detected when dealing with higher polyphony and how effectively this type of
model can face a very dense scene with up to 10 overlapping birds. We found
that models trained with denser examples (i.e., higher polyphony) learn at a
similar rate as models that used simpler samples in their training set.
Additionally, the model trained with the densest samples maintained a
consistent score for all polyphonies, while the model trained with the least
dense samples degraded as the polyphony increased. Our results demonstrate that
highly dense acoustic scenarios can be dealt with using CRNNs. We expect that
this study serves as a starting point for working on highly populated bird
scenarios such as dawn chorus or other dense acoustic problems.},
